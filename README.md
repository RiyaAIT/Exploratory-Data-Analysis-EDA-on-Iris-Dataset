# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-Iris-Dataset

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in data science and machine learning, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers across three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes measurements of four features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. Conducting EDA on this dataset provides insights into the relationships between species and features, and it aids in visualizing separability among species.

Through EDA:

1.Summarize the Data: Check for missing values, outliers, and basic statistics of each feature.

2.Visualize Distributions: Use histograms, box plots, and violin plots to analyze the spread of each feature within and across species.

3.Examine Relationships: Scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices reveal relationships and patterns, especially between petal and sepal dimensions, which are useful in distinguishing species.
